<p> The word book comes from Old English bōc, which in turn comes from the Germanic root *bōk-, cognate to </p>
<p> 'beech'. In Slavic languages like Russian, Bulgarian, Macedonian буква bukva—'letter' is cognate with </p>
<p> 'beech'. In Russian, Serbian and Macedonian, the word букварь (bukvar') or буквар (bukvar) refers </p>
<p> to a primary school textbook that helps young children master the techniques of reading and writing. </p>
<p> It is thus conjectured that the earliest Indo-European writings may have been carved on beech wood. </p>
<p> The Latin word codex, meaning a book in the modern sense (bound and with separate leaves), originally meant </p>
<p> 'block of wood'. The methods used for the printing and binding of books continued fundamentally unchanged </p>
<p> from the 15th century into the early 20th century. While there was more mechanization, a book printer in 1900 </p>
<p> had much in common with Gutenberg. Gutenberg's invention was the use of movable metal types, assembled into </p>
<p> words, lines, and pages and then printed by letterpress to create multiple copies. Modern paper books are </p>
<p> printed on papers designed specifically for printed books. Traditionally, book papers are off-white or </p>
<p> low-white papers (easier to read), are opaque to minimise the show-through of text from one side of the page </p>
<p> to the other and are (usually) made to tighter caliper or thickness specifications, particularly for </p>
<p> case-bound books. Different paper qualities are used depending on the type of book: Machine finished coated </p>
<p> papers, woodfree uncoated papers, coated fine papers and special fine papers are common paper grades. </p>
