<h1>Book</h1>

<p> A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of </p>
<p> many pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover.</p>
<p> The technical term for this physical arrangement is codex (plural, codices). In the history of hand-held </p>
<p> physical supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its predecessor, </p>
<p> the scroll. A single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page. </p>
<p>As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes a </p>
<p> considerable investment of time to compose and a still considerable, though not so extensive, investment </p>
<p> of time to read. In a restricted sense, a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, </p>
<p> a usage that reflects the fact that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several scrolls and each </p>
<p> scroll had to be identified by the book it contained. Each part of Aristotle's Physics is called a book. </p>
<p> In an unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which such sections, whether called books </p>
<p> or chapters or parts, are parts.The intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition, </p>
<p> nor even be called a book. Books can consist only of drawings, engravings or photographs, crossword puzzles </p>
<p> or cut-out dolls. In a physical book, the pages can be left blank or can feature an abstract set of lines to </p>
<p> support entries, in an account book, an appointment book, an autograph book, a notebook, a diary or a </p>
<p> sketchbook. Some physical books are made with pages thick and sturdy enough to support other physical </p>
<p> objects, like a scrapbook or photograph album. Books may be distributed in electronic form as e-books and </p>
<p> other formats. Although in ordinary academic parlance a monograph is understood to be a specialist academic </p>
<p> work, rather than a reference work on a scholarly subject, in library and information science monograph </p>
<p> denotes more broadly any non-serial publication complete in one volume (book) or a finite number of volumes </p>
<p> (even a novel like Proust's seven-volume In Search of Lost Time), in contrast to serial publications like a </p>
<p> magazine, journal or newspaper. An avid reader or collector of books is a bibliophile or colloquially, </p>
<p> "bookworm". A place where books are traded is a bookshop or bookstore. Books are also sold elsewhere and can </p>
<p> be borrowed from libraries. Google has estimated that in 2010, approximately 130,000,000 titles had been </p>
<p> published. In some wealthier nations, the sale of printed books has decreased because of the increased </p>
<p> usage of e-books. </p>
